      "content=\"Parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech and sounds due to several biological and behavioral factors:\\n\\n1. **Brain Structure**: Parrots have a highly developed brain structure called the nidopallium, which is responsible for learning and vocalization. This area of the brain allows them to imitate complex sounds.\\n\\n2. **Repetition Learning**: Like many birds, parrots learn through repetition. They hear human voices and other sounds repeatedly in their environment and try to mimic these sounds as a way of communication or social bonding.\\n\\n3. **Social Behavior**: Parrots are highly social animals and often engage in vocalizations as part of their communication with others. Mimicking human speech can be a form of play, learning, or even expressing emotions.\\n\\n4. **Curiosity**: Parrots are naturally curious about their environment and the sounds they hear. They may mimic human speech out of curiosity rather than any specific need to communicate.\\n\\n5. **Cultural Influence**: In some cases, parrots may learn to mimic human speech because they are exposed to it frequently in their homes or environments. This can include hearing family members talk, watching TV, or listening to music.\\n\\n6. **Training and Interaction**: Positive reinforcement training can also contribute to a parrot's ability to mimic human speech. When a parrot is rewarded for mimicking sounds, it may continue to do so.\\n\\nIt's important to note that while parrots can learn to mimic human speech, they don't always understand the meaning behind what they are saying. Their vocalizations are often more about communication and social interaction than true understanding of language.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'model': 'qwen2.5-coder:7b', 'created_at': '2026-02-18T15:15:20.4356195Z', 'done': True, 'done_reason': 'stop', 'total_duration': 40295682400, 'load_duration': 99773300, 'prompt_eval_count': 35, 'prompt_eval_duration': 658638500, 'eval_count': 324, 'eval_duration': 38690438300, 'logprobs': None, 'model_name': 'qwen2.5-coder:7b', 'model_provider': 'ollama'} id='lc_run--019c7151-4f8b-7141-9b14-310f65fa1410-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 35, 'output_tokens': 324, 'total_tokens': 359}\n"
