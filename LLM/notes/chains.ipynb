      "2. **Seasonal Variations and Urban-Rural Divide:** Unemployment rates fluctuate seasonally, with higher rates during the monsoon season due to agricultural activities and lower rates during peak tourist seasons. Urban areas have a higher unemployment rate than rural areas, partly due to industry concentration and migration from rural areas.\n",

      "\n",
      "## Purpose:\n",
      "Support vector machines (SVMs) are versatile machine learning algorithms used for classification, regression, and outlier detection.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Advantages:\n",
      "- **Effective in high-dimensional spaces:** SVMs perform well even when the number of features is much larger than the number of samples.\n",
      "- **Memory efficient:** They use only a subset of training points (support vectors), which makes them memory efficient.\n",
      "- **Versatile with different kernel functions available:** SVMs can be adapted to various types of data and problems through the choice of kernel functions.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Disadvantages:\n",
      "- **Over-fitting risk:** When the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, there is a higher risk of over-fitting.\n",
      "- **Lack of direct probability estimates:** SVMs do not provide direct probability estimates, which can be computationally expensive to obtain through cross-validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Input Data:\n",
      "SVMs support both dense and sparse data formats. For optimal performance, use C-ordered numpy.ndarray or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix with dtype=float64.\n",
      "\n",

      "# Quiz\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **What are the primary uses of support vector machines?**\n",
      "   - Support vector machines are used for classification, regression, and outliers detection.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **What are some advantages of using support vector machines?**\n",
      "   - Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
      "   - Still effective when the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
      "   - Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (support vectors), making it memory efficient.\n",
      "   - Versatile, with different kernel functions available for the decision function.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **What are some disadvantages of support vector machines?**\n",
      "   - Over-fitting can occur if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples.\n",
      "   - SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates; these require expensive five-fold cross-validation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **How does scikit-learn handle input data for support vector machines?**\n",
      "   - It supports both dense (numpy.ndarray and convertible to that by numpy.asarray) and sparse (any scipy.sparse) sample vectors as input.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **What are the recommendations for optimal performance when using SVMs with sparse data?**\n",
      "   - Use C-ordered numpy.ndarray (dense) or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (sparse) with dtype=float64.\n",

    "\n",
    "Effective in high dimensional spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of support vector machines include:\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoid over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "SVMs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation (see Scores and probabilities, below).\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vector machines in scikit-learn support both dense (numpy.ndarray and convertible to that by numpy.asarray) and sparse (any scipy.sparse) sample vectors as input. However, to use an SVM to make predictions for sparse data, it must have been fit on such data. For optimal performance, use C-ordered numpy.ndarray (dense) or scipy.sparse.csr_matrix (sparse) with dtype=float64.\n",
