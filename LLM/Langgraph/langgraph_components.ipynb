    "- Langgraph is orchestration framework that enables you to build stateful, multistep and event driven workflows using LLM. its ideal for designing both single agent and multi agent ai applications.\n",
    "- Think of langgraph as a flowchart engine for LLMs.\n",
    "- Langgraph handles workflow orchestration , while langchain provides the building blocks for each step in that workflows.\n",
    "- It enables advanced features like parallelism, loops, branching, memory and resumability, making it ideal for agentic & production grade AI applications."
